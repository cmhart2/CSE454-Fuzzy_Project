Fuzzy Inference Engine
======================

About
-----

This project uses a fuzzy autonomous control system for a robot in order to take the robot from the starting position to the destination. The robot must start with a velocity of zero, and an angle of zero. The robot is only able to change its forward speed and the angle it is facing. The robot must start at a position inputted by the user, and travel to a predetermined destination.

Getting Started
---------------

Open the directory in MATLAB R2021b. Run the file called `Fuzzy_App.mlapp`. Upon running, a MATLAB app should open up. Edit the preset start coordinates and destination coordinates for the robot, if desired. Click the button that says "Start" to begin the robot's journey to its destination. The robot is indicated by the blue circle, and the destination is indicated by the black "x".

Requirements
------------

You must be using the most current release of MATLAB. In addidion, you must have the MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Designer Application installed. More information on the requirements lies below.
