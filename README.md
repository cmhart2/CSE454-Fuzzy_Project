Fuzzy Inference Engine

About
--

This project utilizes a fuzzy inference engine in order to make the decisions for a robot which must navigate from a starting point to a destination point.

--
Getting Started
--

Open the directory in MATLAB R2021b. Run the file `fuzzy_project_cmhart2.mlx`. Upon running, you should see a small prompt pop up. Enter the robot's starting X and Y-coordinates which can range from 0 to 100, then click "OK". Another prompt should pop up, in which you should enter the robot's destination X and Y-coordinates and click "OK" to continue.

At this point, a new window will open in the MATLAB application
